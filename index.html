            For the past few years, the Twitch platform has seen over hundreds of games that became
            hot and trending. While some games have died out as a fad and some continue to dominate
            the charts on Twitch, we show the larger picture of what types of genres the users will
            continue to watch. The heatmap below shows the genres of the top 200 games every month
            from 2016 to 2021.
